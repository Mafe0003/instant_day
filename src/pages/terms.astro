    <Text teksttype="Light" stylingclasses="col-start-3 col-span-8 pt-5 lg:pt-7"> <span class="font-bold">Instant Photo:</span><br>
Every submission has to be an analogue instant photo - not a digital montage made in a photo editing suite. The instant can be made in various ways, with analogue instant cameras, digital instant cameras like ie. the Fujifilm EVO or scan-and-print tools like ie. the Polaroid Lab. The instant photo can be manipulated with analogue processes - the organizers encourage instant photography experiments. The submission can depict the instant photo in many ways: As a flat scan without or without the instant photo frame, as a photo showing the instants in a frame, on the wall etc. The instant doesnâ€™t need to be just one photo: It can be a panorama or collage of multiple instants that make up one submission.
